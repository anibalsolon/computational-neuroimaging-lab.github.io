            <h2>There are two job openings in the CNL</h2>

<h3>Post-Doctoral Fellow Position</h3>

<p><a id="#postdoc"></a>Applications are currently being invited for a Post-Doctoral Fellow position available in the <a href="http://computational-neuroimaging-lab.org">Computational Neuroimaging Lab (CNL)</a> at the <a href="http://www.childmind.org">Child Mind Institute</a>, under the direction of Cameron Craddock, PhD. The overarching goal of the CNLâ€™s research is the identification of objective imaging-based markers of pathology to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness. The primary responsibility of this position is to develop novel analytical methods that integrate information from a variety of imaging modalities (resting state and task fMRI, real-time fMRI, EEG, DTI, structural MRI), with brain stimulation techniques (tDCS, tACS, TMS), and phenotypic variables for the characterization of brain development and function in clinical and non-clinical populations. To facilitate their research, fellows will work as a part of a highly collaborative and multidisciplinary team that integrates a broad range of disparate specialties (e.g. cognitive neuroscience, clinical psychology, computer science, engineering, mathematics).</p>

<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Large-scale analysis of fMRI, simultaneous EEG/fMRI, DTI and structural neuroimaging data.</li>
<li>Develop and maintain open source software tools for preprocessing, analyzing, and curating neuroimaging data.</li>
<li>Author manuscripts and presentations describing accomplished research.</li>
<li>Supervise junior level researchers and graduate students.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Qualifications:</h4>

<ul>
<li>PhD in biomedical engineering, cognitive science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or physics.</li>
<li>Significant prior neuroimaging experience with MRI, with strong skills in preprocessing and analyzing neuroimaging data using one or more of the common neuroimaging packages (e.g., AFNI, FSL, Freesurfer, Diffusion Toolbkit, or SPM).</li>
<li>Programming experience in C/C++, Matlab, Python, and similar platforms.</li>
<li>Motivated self-starter with great attitude and flexibility.</li>
<li>Ability to work in a fast paced environment.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Salary and Anticipated Start Date:</h4>

<p>Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience/educational qualifications.  Benefits include health, vision, and dental. Anticipated Start Date is immediate.</p>

<h4>Application details:</h4>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto://cameron.craddock@childmind.org">cameron.craddock@childmind.org</a> to apply, please include a CV including the names of 3 references with your inquiry.</p>

<p>Employment at Will Relationship: This position description does not constitute a guarantee that employment will continue for any specified period of time. Rather, employment is at the mutual consent of the employee and CMI, and can be terminated at will by the employee or by CMI.</p>

<p>CMI reserves the right to modify the job description and/or reporting relationship at any time.</p>

<p>CMI is an Equal Opportunity Employer. CMI is committed to recruiting and maintaining a diverse staff; individuals from all backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply.</p>

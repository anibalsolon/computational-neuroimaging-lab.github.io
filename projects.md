## Real-time fMRI Neurofeedback Based Stratification of Default Network Regulation
This project capitalizes on recent innovations in real-time fMRI (RT-fMRI) based neurofeedback to provide a dimensional profile of DN regulation that can be linked to cognitive and psychiatric phenotyping profiles, as well as underlying brain architecture. *This project is funded by NIMH BRAINS RO1: 1R01MH101555-01.*  

## Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes
The Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) is an open-source software pipeline for automated preprocessing and analysis of resting-state fMRI data. C-PAC builds upon a robust set of existing software packages including AFNI, FSL, and FreeSurfer, and makes it easy for both novice users and experts to explore their data using a wide array of analytic tools.

## Preprocessed Connectomes Project
The goal of the Preprocessed Connectomes Project (PCP) is to systematically preprocess datasets available in neuroimaging datasharing repositories and to share the results. The hope is to engage a broad audience of data scientists and neuroscientists in neuroimaging research by reducing the barrier to entry. <a href="http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.github.io" target="_blank">[webpage]</a>


## Characterizing inter-individual variation in the functional connectome
The Computational Neuroimaging Laboratory has several previous and current research projects aimed at developing methods for mapping inter-individual variation in the functional connectome:

- Whole brain functional parcellation: <a href="http://ccraddock.github.io/cluster_roi">[source code]</a> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21769991" target="_blank">[publication]</a>
- Predicting intrinsic brain activity: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23707580" target="_blank">[publication]</a>
- Disease state prediction: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19859933" target="_blank">[publication]</a>

## Data Sharing
The Computational Neuroimaging Laboratory helps maintain and shares data through the <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/">International Neuroimaging Datasharing Intiative</a>. This includes administering a <a href="https://github.com/FCP-INDI/fcp_indi_bucket_maintenance">public S3 bucket to for hosting the data</a>. Datasets contributed to in whole or in part by the CNL include:

- <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/ibatrt.html">Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility Intrinsic Brain Activity Test re-Test dataset</a> - Structural and functional MRI, including two resting state fMRI and two multi-source interference task fMRI scans for 36 participants, 14 of which were scanned during a second session.
- <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/index.html">Nathan Kline Institute Enhanced Rockland Sample</a> - Structural and functional scans including a real time fMRI neurofeedback experiment and deep phenotyping on 200 participants 18 - 45 years old, as a part of the larger Rockland Sample dataset that includes deep phenotyping and a connectomic scanning on over 1,500 particpants aged 6 - 90.
- <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/hbn_ssi/"> Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network Serial Scanning Initiative</a> - While a part of the CMI, the CNL designed and oversaw the collection of this datasets, which includes structural and functional MRI on 13 adult participants (ages: 21-42), repeatedly scanned under each of four scan conditions across 12 sessions.
- <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/hbn_ssi/"> Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network</a> - While a part of the CMI, the CNL designed and oversaw the collection of this datasets, which aims to collect structural and functional MRI on over 10,000 children with a variety of mental health and learning disorders (ages 5-21).

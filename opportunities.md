### <a name="PD_CPAC"></a> Post-Doctoral Fellow @ CMI:  Evaluation and development of neuroimaging data processing and analysis methods.
<a id="#postdoc"></a>The primary responsibilities of this position will be to develop and evaluate analytical methods for the large scale (>> 1,000 datasets) processing and analysis of multimodal MRI neuroimaging data. Using multivariate methods, the incumbent will integrate information from disparate imaging modalities to identify clinically relevant subpopulations and related neurophenotypes from datasets that span a variety of disorders. The incumbent will be expected to conduct large-scale neuroimaging analyses (functional, structural, and diffusion MRI). They will mentor and in some cases supervise junior lab members such as research associates and graduate students. They must be able to work effectively in a very collaborative and multidisciplinary environment, write scientific manuscripts, and orally present their work.

#### Qualifications:
- PhD in biomedical engineering, cognitive science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or physics.
- Significant prior neuroimaging experience with MRI, with strong skills in preprocessing and analyzing neuroimaging data using one or more of the common neuroimaging packages (e.g., AFNI, FSL, Freesurfer, Diffusion Toolkit, or SPM).
- Programming experience in C/C++, Matlab, Python, and similar platforms.

#### Salary and Anticipated Start Date:  
Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience/educational qualifications.  Benefits include health, vision, and dental. Anticipated Start Date is immediate.

#### Application details:
Please email [cameron.craddock@childmind.org](mailto://cameron.craddock@childmind.org) to apply, please include a CV including the names of 3 references with your inquiry.

Employment at Will Relationship: This position description does not constitute a guarantee that employment will continue for any specified period of time. Rather, employment is at the mutual consent of the employee and CMI, and can be terminated at will by the employee or by CMI.

CMI reserves the right to modify the job description and/or reporting relationship at any time.

CMI is an Equal Opportunity Employer. CMI is committed to recruiting and maintaining a diverse staff; individuals from all backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply.

### <a name="PD_NFB"></a> Post-Doctoral Fellow @ NKI: Probing brain networks with real-time fMRI
The primary responsibility of this research position will be to investigate the role of network dysregulation in psychiatric disorders using real-time fMRI. This will involve developing and maintaining a real-time fMRI system, as well as designing, implementing and performing real-time fMRI experiments. The incumbent will be expected to conduct large-scale neuroimaging analyses (functional, structural, and diffusion MRI). They will mentor and in some cases supervise junior lab members such as research associates and graduate students. They must be able to work effectively in a very collaborative and multidisciplinary environment, write scientific manuscripts, and orally present their work.

#### Qualifications:
- PhD in biomedical engineering, cognitive science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or physics.
- Research experience with functional, structural, and diffusion MRI acquisition and analysis.  
- Proficient with common neuroimaging tools (AFNI, FSL, SPM, Freesurfer, etc), as well as programming C/C++, Python, and shell scripting.
- Strong skills in using data analysis tools such as Matlab and R.
- Prior real-time fMRI and/or MRI sequence development experience is a strong plus.

#### Salary and Anticipated Start Date:  
Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience/educational qualifications.  Benefits include health, vision, and dental. Anticipated Start Date is immediate.

### <a name="DA"></a> Data Analyst @ NKI
The primary responsibility of this position will be the the processing of large scale neuroimaging datasets for CNL investigators and collaborators, using state-of-the-art image processing pipelines (e.g., functional MRI, structural MRI, diffusion imaging and arterial spin labeling). The analyst will also support investigators in the analysis of datasets using a combination of univariate and multivariate analytic approaches (e.g., machine learning theory). Successful candidates must have sufficient technical skills (e.g., C/C++, Python, R) to independently modify processing pipelines and apply novel data analysis strategies. As experience grows, the analyst will be expected to provide supervision for junior researchers in their analytic efforts.

#### Qualifications:
- MS in Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or other related scientific fields.
- Proficient in programming C/C++, Matlab, Python or R.
- Extensive experience with one or more MRI data analysis packages (e.g., AFNI, FSL or SPM)
- Prior experience with functional MRI or diffusion imaging processing pipelines
- Proficiency in the application of multivariate analytic techniques (including machine learning theory) strongly preferred)

#### Salary and Anticipated Start Date:  
Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience/educational qualifications.  Benefits include health, vision, and dental. Anticipated Start Date is immediate.
